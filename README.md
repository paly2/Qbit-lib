# Qbit lib

Qbit lib is a basic library which simulates Qbits (quantum bits) on classical computers. It's very useful to know what it could happen on a quantum computer for example.

## How to test it

On GNU/Linuw systems, you can use:  
`g++ test.cpp qbit.cpp -std=c++0x`  
`./a.out`

Then, look at the result (the `test.cpp` file comments must help you to understand what you're seeing).
